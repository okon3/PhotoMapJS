PhotoMapJS
==========

Client side map that displays your photos.
(Needs the EXIF tags with the GPS Latitude/Longitude, turn it on in your smartphone camera app)

You can see a demo here:

Since it's a full Javascript implementation there is no upload of photos, so it's as fast as if it was a desktop application (and no one will ever steal your naked photos!).
