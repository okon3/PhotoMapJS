PhotoMapJS
==========

Client side map that displays your photos.
(Needs the EXIF tags with the GPS Latitude/Longitude, turn it on in your smartphone camera app)

You can see a demo here:
http://okon3.github.io/PhotoMapJS/

(In the bottom part of the page there is the directory picker. Pick the directory with all your photos [it scans the directory recursively and picks only the images])

Since it's a full Javascript implementation there is no upload of photos, so it's as fast as if it was a desktop application.
